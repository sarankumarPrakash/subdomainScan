# ABOUT SUBSCAN 

**Subscan** is a JavaScript-based tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques. It assists penetration testers, bug hunters, and security researchers in collecting and identifying subdomains associated with a specific domain. Subscan leverages search engines, such as Google, and other public sources to gather subdomain information, making it a powerful asset for security assessments and reconnaissance activities.
